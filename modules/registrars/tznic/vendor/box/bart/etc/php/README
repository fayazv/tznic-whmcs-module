Historically this directory contained any configuration files for Bart PHP
scripts. This approach has ended up being a bit of a pain to maintain.
Particularly as more people are composing other projects on top of Bart.

Future configuration code written in Bart will aim to use the new framework
stemming from \Bart\Configuration\Configuration, which allows the user to
configure a separate root configuration directory (i.e. not in the git tree)
in which all configurations can be found.

The intended use is for scripts to configure the Configuration framework when
starting; and for configuration files to be managed externally by a system
configuration tool like Puppet or Chef in a directory like /etc/php/app
